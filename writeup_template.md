###1. The Pipeline

My pipeline consists of 5 steps. 

First we Gaussian blur the image to smooth jaggies. Then we perform Canny edge detection to get an image that just has edges in it shown.

We mask off a region that we expect to see the lane lines in, and we detect lines with a Hough transform.

Now we have line co-ordinates.

We can draw these over the video for each frame, which works fine, but often but itâ€™s a bit of a mess.
